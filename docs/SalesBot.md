It’s no secret that it’s harder than ever to close deals thanks to
rapid changes in today’s economy. Many companies now face the
challenge of selling their solutions in marketplaces where their
products and services are becoming commoditized. Even their
best sales executives are having trouble conveying the value of
what they have to offer to customers and prospects – who are
more demanding and unpredictable than ever. The companies
that are thriving today are those that have figured out how to
close deals successfully in today’s marketplaces, despite these
obstacles.

Here, we'll guide you through the process of creating an
Implementation Plan created by Jeff Thull, so you can begin
figuring out how to use complex sale techniques in your
organization!

Use this implementation plan as a starting point for making this
happen. You can download a copy to print and work through your
responses or work on the responses directly. In this plan, we'll
guide you through a very simplified version of the Mastering the
Complex Sale process.

The keys to creating an effective plan are honesty and
thoughtfulness: these plans are designed to give you practical
action steps based on your answers to the questions in the
following template.

Nobody knows your business better than you, so that's where the
best insights are going to come from. You're all set - let's begin!


## ACTION 1: ANALYZE YOUR CURRENT STATE

Think carefully about the definition of the three eras of selling. Being honest with yourself,
which era is your company performing in?

What are the main indicators that your organization is in the era you selected?

## ACTION 2: ANALYZE YOUR CURRENT INITIAL SALES CONVERSATIONS

Write out a typical conversation you would have with a potential customer. Make it 1-
paragraphs long.

Now, go back over your conversation and identify how many of the items on the list below
apply to your sales conversation, or which characteristics you tend to see from your
customers:

```
You followed a set presentation or script
```
```
A large percentage of your sales proposal is devoted to describing your company,
solution or customer's future
```
```
A large percentage of your sales proposal is spent clarifying your customer's business
situation, problems, risks, etc.
```
```
You assume your customer understands their problems or risks already
```
```
You speak to your customer in language that suggests your solution is best for their
problem
```
```
Your customers react defensively or challenge your recommendations
```
Did you check off over half of the items in the checkboxes? This may be a sign you need to
rethink how you phrase your conversations and gear them to be more like Era 3 sales
conversations.


## ACTION 3: EVALUATING WHERE YOUR CUSTOMER IS ON THE PROGRESSION TO

## CHANGE SCALE

It's important to understand where your customer is when you frame and embark on the
journey to getting them to buy into your product or service. To complete this exercise, think
of a potential customer you currently have.

Write down some of the things this customer said in conversations with you that indicate
where they are in their intent to buy:

Now, look at the chart. Thinking about all the things you wrote above, where do you think
your customer is on the Progression of Change scale?

What are things you could do to get this customer to move one or two spaces up the scale
to be more open to your product or service?

What value does your product or service bring on the product level itself? This is the obvious
level of value. Examples are: speed of product, level of maintenance, features, etc.

## ACTION 4: IDENTIFYING YOUR VALUE LEAKAGE

As the seminar illustrates, only 10% of the value of your service or product is captured during
the sales proposal. In the following spaces, try to map out what kind of value your product or
services can bring in each of the following areas.

# CHALLENGE 3: THE CHALLENGE OF VALUE

```

```
```

```
```
Product Process
```
```
Level of Service and Support Provided
```
```
Performance
```

What value does your product or service bring on the process level? What process in an
organization is your product or service going to impact? What potential ways can it impact
the processes that surround that specific process?

What value does your product or service bring on the performance level? Once your product
value affects the processes in a company, how does that tie into the overall company's
performance?

Do you have any experience with or other tips about building an impactful organization that
could benefit the community?
